# CCD/SSCS Docker :whale:

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

*Memory and CPU allocations may need to be increased for successful execution of ccd applications altogether. (On Preferences / Advanced)*

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) - minimum version 2.0.57 
- [jq Json Processor] (https://stedolan.github.io/jq)

## Quick start

### Bringing down an existing setup

#### 1. The Regular Way

```bash
./ccd compose down
```

#### 2. The Brute Force Option

If you find yourself in a bit of a mess, you may want to destroy all your containers and images with the following command. This will make bringing it all up again
slower as it will need to download the images again.

```bash
./bin/docker-clean.sh
```

### Bringing it up

To bring up the containers, run the following from the root directory of the cloned repository:

```bash
./bin/compose-up.sh
```

### Ready for take-off ðŸ›«

If all went well, the above script will have performed the following tasks:

* Pulled the latest docker images
* Bring up the docker containers using docker-compose
* Created the SIDAM services and roles using a Selenium script against SIDAM admin frontend.
* Created the import user and the caseworker user specified in the .env file
* Replace the AAT callback URLS in the CCD defintions to point to local services
* Imported the CCD defintions specified in the .env file

You can now visit [http://localhost:3451](http://localhost:3451), you can now log in using the email address defined in the .env file (HMCTS_EMAIL_ADDRESS) along with the password `Pa55word11`.
