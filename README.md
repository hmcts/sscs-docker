# CCD/SSCS Docker :whale:

## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) - minimum version 2.0.57 
- [jq Json Processor] (https://stedolan.github.io/jq)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Java 8](https://www.java.com)

You can increase the memory available to Docker from the Preferences|Advanced options on your Docker installation. We recommend allocating 12G. The SIDAM containers
are quite hungry.

## Quick start

First...

	cp .env.example .env

Then make the necessary changes at the top of the file.

***Note*** If you find yourself in a bit of a mess, you may want to destroy all your containers and images with the following command. This will make bringing it all up again slower as it will need to download the images again.

```bash
./bin/docker-clean.sh
```

### Bringing it up

To bring up the containers, run the following from the root directory of the cloned repository:

```bash
./bin/compose-up.sh
```

### Ready for take-off ðŸ›«

If all went well, the above script will have performed the following tasks:

* Pulled the latest docker images
* Bring up the docker containers using docker-compose
* Created the SIDAM services and roles using a Selenium script against SIDAM admin frontend.
* Created the import user and the caseworker user specified in the .env file
* Replace the AAT callback URLS in the CCD defintions to point to local services
* Imported the CCD defintions specified in the .env file

You can now visit [http://localhost:3451](http://localhost:3451), you can now log in using
 
    local.test@example.com

### Optional Compose Containers

Optional compose files can be found in the /compose directory. You can enable any of the optional container setups with a command such as:

    ./ccd enable pdf-service-api
    
And then run the following command:

    ./ccd compose up -d

### Replace Callback Urls

To manually replace the callback URLs you can run this script:

    ./gradlew run --args="~/defintions/CCD_SSCSDefinition_v5.1.01_AAT.xlsx url-swaps.yml"

### Import Case Definition

To manually import the case definition you can run this script:

    ./bin/ccd-import-definition.sh ~/defintions/CCD_SSCSDefinition_v5.1.01_AAT.xlsx
